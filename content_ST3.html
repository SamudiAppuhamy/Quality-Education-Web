                    <p>Many regions face critical teacher shortages, particularly in STEM subjects, special education, and rural areas. This often leads to overcrowded classrooms, unqualified teachers, or complete lack of educational access.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Inadequate Preparation</h3>
                    <p>In many contexts, teacher preparation programs lack rigor, practical experience, or alignment with classroom realities. The gap between theory and practice leaves new teachers unprepared for the complexities of teaching.</p>

                    <p>Once in the classroom, many teachers receive minimal ongoing support or professional learning opportunities. One-off workshops without follow-up or coaching rarely lead to sustained improvement in teaching practice.</p>
